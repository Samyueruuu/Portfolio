      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m <strong>Samuel Rouell M. Mazon</strong>, a recent Bachelor of Science in Information Technology 
        graduate from <strong>Marinduque State University</strong>, majoring in Software Development. 
        I’m passionate about creating efficient, user-friendly solutions through web development, 
        as well as solving real-world IT problems with both hardware and software troubleshooting.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have hands-on experience as a <strong>Freelance Web Designer</strong> and 
        <strong>Freelance Technician</strong>, where I designed responsive websites using 
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and provided technical support for computer hardware, 
        software, and network systems. I also completed my internship as an 
        <strong>IT Support Intern</strong> at the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), 
        where I worked on hardware/software troubleshooting, system maintenance, database updates, 
        and fiber wiring installation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy tackling challenges that combine creativity with technical problem-solving. 
        With skills in <strong>web development</strong>, <strong>UI/UX design</strong>, 
        and <strong>IT support</strong>, I aim to grow further in the tech industry while contributing 
        to innovative and impactful projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work, I’m continuously learning and experimenting with new tools and technologies 
        to sharpen my skills as both a developer and IT professional.
      </p>
